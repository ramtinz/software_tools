# Here is a Linux shell script that can be used to check if R is available and provide options to install it if it is not:

# This script uses the command -v command to check if the R command is available. If it is not available, it prompts the user to install R and then installs it using the appropriate package manager (either yum, apt-get, or dnf).

# Check if R is available
if command -v R &>/dev/null; then
  echo "R is available."
else
  echo "R is not available."
  # Prompt the user to install R
  read -p "Do you want to install R? [Y/n] " install_r
  if [ "$install_r" = "Y" ] || [ "$install_r" = "y" ]; then
    # Install R using the package manager
    if command -v yum &>/dev/null; then
      # Use yum to install R
      yum install R
    elif command -v apt-get &>/dev/null; then
      # Use apt-get to install R
      apt-get install r-base
    elif command -v dnf &>/dev/null; then
      # Use dnf to install R
      dnf install R
    else
      echo "No package manager was found. R cannot be installed."

# To use this script, simply save it to a file and make it executable with the chmod command, then run it with ./filename. It will check if R is available and provide options to install it if necessary.
