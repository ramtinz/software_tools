# Here is a Linux shell script that can be used to check if Docker is available and provide options to install it if it is not:

# Check if Docker is available
if command -v docker &>/dev/null; then
  echo "Docker is available."
else
  echo "Docker is not available."
  # Prompt the user to install Docker
  read -p "Do you want to install Docker? [Y/n] " install_docker
  if [ "$install_docker" = "Y" ] || [ "$install_docker" = "y" ]; then
    # Install Docker using the package manager
    if command -v yum &>/dev/null; then
      # Use yum to install Docker
      yum install docker
    elif command -v apt-get &>/dev/null; then
      # Use apt-get to install Docker
      apt-get install docker
    elif command -v dnf &>/dev/null; then
      # Use dnf to install Docker
      dnf install docker
    else
      echo "No package manager was found. Docker cannot be installed."

# This script uses the command -v command to check if the docker command is available. If it is not available, it prompts the user to install Docker and then installs it using the appropriate package manager (either yum, apt-get, or dnf).

# To use this script, simply save it to a file and make it executable with the chmod command, then run it with ./filename. It will check if Docker is available and provide options to install it if necessary.
