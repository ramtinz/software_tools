There are several tools that you can use to check available resources and running jobs on a Red Hat Linux system. Here are some options:

top: This is a real-time system monitoring tool that provides information about CPU, memory, and swap usage, as well as the processes that are using the most resources.

free: This command shows the amount of free and used memory in the system, as well as the amount of swap space available.

vmstat: This command displays information about system memory, paging, block IO, and CPU activity.

mpstat: This command displays information about the average CPU utilization across all CPUs.

pidstat: This command shows statistics for Linux processes, including CPU and memory usage.

sar: This command collects, reports, and saves system activity information. You can use it to monitor a wide range of system performance metrics, including CPU, memory, and disk usage.

htop: This is an interactive system monitoring tool that displays real-time information about CPU, memory, and process usage. It provides a more user-friendly interface than the top command.

These are just a few examples of the tools that are available for monitoring resources and processes on Red Hat Linux. You can use these tools to get a better understanding of how your system is performing and identify any potential performance issues.
